## Adafruit IO API .Net Library

This Library is intended to be used to provide easy access to your Adafruit IO Data. All the API functionality is exposed to be used easily. Additional abstraction is made, to provide an easy way to get the data you want into your Adafruit IO Feed and also back out of it. It is stored as .Json, so this can easily be used if other applications that are not using this library are accessing your feeds. See also [here](https://github.com/HannesZeihsel/adafruit-io-api).
